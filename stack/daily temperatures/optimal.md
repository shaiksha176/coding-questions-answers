## Optimized Approach: Monotonic Stack

The idea behind the stack-based approach is to maintain a stack that stores indices of the temperatures array in decreasing order of their temperatures. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. Stack Property:
   1. The stack will store the indices of the temperatures array.
   2. The temperatures at these indices are stored in strictly decreasing order (from bottom to top of the stack).

2. Processing each temperature:
   1. For each temperature, check if it's higher than the temperature of the element at the top index of the stack.
   2. If it is, that means the current temperature is the "next warmer" temperature for the index at the top of the stack.
   3. For each element that is popped from the stack, calculate the difference in indices to find how many days it will take for that element to reach the next warmer day.

3. Push Current Index:
    1. After processing the top of the stack, push the current index onto the stack.

4. Result:
    1. The result array will store how many days each temperature will take to reach a warmer temperature, and it will be updated during the process.


``` javascript

var dailyTemperatures = function(temperatures) {
    const result = new Array(temperatures.length).fill(0);
    const stack = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            const idx = stack.pop();
            result[idx] = i - idx;
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return result;
};

```

## Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the temperatures array. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, so the total number of operations is linear.

Space Complexity: O(n), as we use a stack to store the indices of the temperatures, and we also use an array (result) to store the answer.
