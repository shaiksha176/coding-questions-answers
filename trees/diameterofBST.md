The **diameter of a binary tree** is defined as the **length of the longest path** between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The length of a path is measured by the number of edges between nodes.

### Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the **diameter** of the tree.

### Examples

1

/ \\

2 3

/ \\

4 5

**Output:** 3

Explanation: The longest path is 4 → 2 → 1 → 3 or 5 → 2 → 1 → 3, with a length of 3 edges.

**Example 2:**

1

**Output:** 0

Explanation: The tree has only one node, so there are no edges.

Explanation: The tree has only one node, so there are no edges.

### Solution Using Depth-First Search (DFS)

We can solve this problem using a **DFS** approach. For each node, the longest path passing through it is the sum of the heights (maximum depths) of its left and right subtrees. The **diameter** of the tree is then the maximum of these path lengths for all nodes.

We can calculate the height of each subtree in a recursive DFS function and update the diameter at each node if the current path is longer than the previous maximum.

### Code

Here’s the JavaScript implementation:

``` javascript

var diameterOfBinaryTree = function(root) {

let diameter = 0;

function depth(node) {

if (!node) return 0;

// Recursively find the maximum depth of left and right subtrees

const leftDepth = depth(node.left);

const rightDepth = depth(node.right);

// Update the diameter if the path through the current node is longer

diameter = Math.max(diameter, leftDepth + rightDepth);

// Return the height of the current node

return 1 + Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth);

}

depth(root);

return diameter;

};

```

### Explanation

1.  **Initialize Diameter**: Start with diameter = 0.
    
2.  **DFS Function (depth)**:
    
    *   For each node, calculate the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees.
        
    *   Update the diameter if leftDepth + rightDepth (the longest path through the current node) is greater than the current diameter.
        
    *   Return 1 + Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) as the height of the current node.
        
3.  **Return Result**: After traversing all nodes, diameter will contain the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
    

### Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once to calculate its height.
    
*   **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case, for a skewed tree, this could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(logn).
    

This solution efficiently computes the diameter by reusing the depth calculation and updating the maximum diameter at each step.
