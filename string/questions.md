### **Easy Level**

1.  **Valid Palindrome**Check if a string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
2.  **Reverse String**Reverse a given string in place.
3.  **Reverse Words in a String III**Reverse the order of characters in each word while keeping the word order in the string unchanged.
4.  **First Unique Character in a String**Find the first non-repeating character in a string and return its index.
5.  **Implement strStr()**Return the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, or -1 if not found.
6.  **Longest Common Prefix**Find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.
7.  **Count and Say**Generate the nth term in the "count and say" sequence.
8.  **Valid Anagram**Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
9.  **Add Binary**Add two binary strings and return their sum as a binary string.
10. **Check if Two Strings Are Isomorphic**Determine if two strings are isomorphic (replaceable one-to-one mapping between characters).

### **Medium Level**

1.  **Group Anagrams**Group strings that are anagrams of each other.
2.  **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
3.  **String to Integer (atoi)**Implement a function that converts a string to an integer (handling edge cases).
4.  **Longest Palindromic Substring**Find the longest substring that is a palindrome.
5.  **Multiply Strings**Multiply two non-negative numbers represented as strings.
6.  **Decode String**Decode a string encoded with nested numbers and brackets (e.g., "3\[a2\[c\]\]" -> "accaccacc").
7.  **Find All Anagrams in a String**Find all start indices of anagrams of a string p in a string s.
8.  **Compare Version Numbers**Compare two version numbers given as strings.
9.  **Repeated Substring Pattern**Check if the given string can be constructed by repeating a substring.
10. **Custom Sort String**Sort a string according to the order defined in another string.

11. **Remove Duplicate Letters**Remove duplicate letters to make the smallest lexicographical order string.

12. **Count Binary Substrings**Count the number of substrings with an equal number of consecutive 0s and 1s.

13. **Integer to Roman**Convert an integer to a Roman numeral.
