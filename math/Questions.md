**Easy Level**

1.  **FizzBuzz**Print numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."
2.  **Count Primes**Find the number of prime numbers less than a given number n.
3.  **Reverse Integer**Reverse the digits of an integer.
4.  **Power of Three**Check if a number is a power of three.
5.  **Happy Number**Determine if a number is a happy number (where repeatedly replacing a number by the sum of the squares of its digits eventually equals 1).
6.  **Valid Perfect Square**Check if a number is a perfect square without using built-in square root functions.
7.  **Add Digits**Repeatedly add the digits of a number until a single-digit number is obtained.
8.  **Factorial Trailing Zeroes**Count the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number.
9.  **GCD and LCM**Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
10. **Sqrt(x)**Implement an integer square root function without using built-in functions.

### **Medium Level**

1.  **Integer to Roman**Convert an integer to a Roman numeral.
2.  **Roman to Integer**Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.
3.  **Divide Two Integers**Perform division of two integers without using multiplication, division, or modulo operations.
4.  **Excel Sheet Column Number**Convert an Excel column title (e.g., "AB") to its corresponding column number.
5.  **Ugly Number II**Find the nth ugly number, where an ugly number has only 2, 3, or 5 as prime factors.
6.  **Super Ugly Number**Similar to Ugly Number II, but now the prime factors are provided as an input array.
7.  **Count Numbers with Unique Digits**Count numbers with unique digits for a given range (e.g., from 0 to 10^n).
8.  **Nth Digit**Find the nth digit in the sequence of integers formed by concatenating all numbers (e.g., "123456789101112...").
9.  **Perfect Number**Check if a number is a perfect number (equal to the sum of its proper divisors).
10. **Maximum Product of Word Lengths**Given a list of words, find the maximum product of the lengths of two words such that the two words share no common letters.
